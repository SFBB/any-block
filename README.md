# Any-Block
Protocol describing data structures used in Anytype software.

## Description
We use [Protocol Buffers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_Buffers) to efficiently describe structured data in a binary format for network communication and storage. It offers smaller message sizes and faster serialization/deserialization than JSON or XML. 

Protobuf facilitates data exchange between different systems written in different languages, while also providing automatic code generation for various programming languages.

- `models.proto` describes the base data structures used to represent objects and their components. 
- `changes.proto` outlines CRDT-changes of objects and their blocks. Changes related to block updates are linked to events from `events.proto`. 
- `events.proto` describes the events about the changes of objects and blocks. These events are used to notify clients and also serve as CDRT changes to be stored in an object's tree.

JSON Schemas are generated automatically using [protoc-gen-jsonschema](https://github.com/chrusty/protoc-gen-jsonschema).

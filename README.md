# Any-Block
`any-block` describes data structures used in Anytype software.

## Description
We use [Protocol Buffers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_Buffers) to efficiently describe structured data in a binary format for network communication and storage. It offers smaller message sizes and faster serialization/deserialization than JSON or XML. 

Protobuf facilitates data exchange between different systems written in different languages, while also providing automatic code generation for various programming languages.

`models.proto` â€”
`changes.proto` â€” 
`events.proto` â€”
`snapshot.proto` â€”
